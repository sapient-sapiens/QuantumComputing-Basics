# QuantumComputing-Basics

These are my implementations of three beginner-Level projects in Python. 

1. Quantum Coin Flip Simulation: Simulating a fair coin flip using a qubit in a superposition of states. 

2. Build a simple quantum random number generator. By measuring a qubit in a superposition state, you can generate a truly random 0 or 1.

3. Quantum Teleportation Protocol
